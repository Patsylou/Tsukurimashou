This copy of the Tsukurimashou source code is being checked into Github to
increase its visibility, and I will try to keep it up to date, but the
official location for Tsukurimashou development is on Sourceforge.JP:

   http://sourceforge.jp/projects/tsukurimashou/

Submit all bug reports, support requests, patches, and other items related
to Tsukurimashou development through Sourceforge.JP, not through Github.
