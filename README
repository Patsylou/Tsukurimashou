This copy of the Tsukurimashou source code is being checked into Github to
increase its visibility, and I will try to keep it up to date, but the
official location for Tsukurimashou development is on Sourceforge.JP:

   http://osdn.jp/projects/tsukurimashou/

Submit all bug reports, support requests, patches, and other items related
to Tsukurimashou development through Sourceforge.JP, not through Github.

Notwithstanding Github's automated classification, this project is mostly
written in the METAFONT programming language.
