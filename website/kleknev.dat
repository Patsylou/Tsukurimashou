Title: Kleknev
Subtitle: A coarse-grained profiler for build systems, from the Tsukurimashou Project
Main-Text.
<P>Kleknev is a software development tool for measuring resource consumption 
during operations like software builds, which may span thousands of process
invocations and hours of real time in a multiprocessor environment.  It is
currently experimental, incomplete, and available only by checkout from the
Tsukurimashou Project's source control system.<P>

<P>Kleknev includes a wrapper which Make can invoke in place of the
Bourne shell, and a reporting program which examines the wrapper's log file
to discover how resources were used during the build.  See
