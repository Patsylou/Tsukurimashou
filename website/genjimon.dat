Main-Text.
<P>The Genjimon (lit. "Genji crests") are a set of 54 abstract
visual designs associated with Japanese culture.  They as used as chapter
numbers in the Heien Period classic <I>The Tale of Genji</I>, which dates
from the turn of the 11th Century; they are also used in an
incense-appreciation game that was popular in that era.  Much later, Edo
Period "floating world" (<I>ukiyo-e</I>) woodblock prints (from the 18th
and 19th Centuries) were sometimes produced in series corresponding to the
Genji chapters; the actual subject matter of the prints might be only
remotely connected to the book.  The Genjimon often appeared on the prints,
and collectors use them to identify the prints within the series.</P>

<P>This package contains six TrueType fonts
for printing the Genjimon in six different styles.
They are released under the GNU General Public License, version 3, with
font-embedding clarification.</P>
