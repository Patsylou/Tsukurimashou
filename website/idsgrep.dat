Main-Text.
<P>IDSgrep is a general tree-matching utility whose main application is to
querying databases of Han-script character structures.  For instance, a user
might ask for all characters with 月 on the right, and get a result
including the characters 明, 朝, and 期.  IDSgrep supports a powerful
language for specifying structural queries, inspired by traditional Unix
regular expression syntax; the structural data itself is represented in an
extended version of Unicode Ideographic Description Sequences.  The
package includes, or can generate, dictionary data from Tsukurimashou,
KanjiVG, CHISE, and EDICT2.</P>
