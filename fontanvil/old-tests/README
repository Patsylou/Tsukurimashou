This is a minimal testsuite for fontanvil. I expect it will grow with time.

You can execute the tests with 'make check' on top level directory or in
this testsuite directory.

Some tests will need extra fonts not bundled with FontForge. You would like
to download them externally and place them inside fonts/ folder in order to
enable the extra tests; otherwise they will be skipped.

test001.pe
  Zapfino-4.0d3.dfont
  Zapfino-4.1d6.dfont

test002.pe
  HanSans-Bold.otf	(any other cid-keyed otf file would do)

test003.pe
  MunhwaGothic-Bold	ftp://ftp.ora.com/pub/examples/nutshell/ujip/adobe/samples/MunhwaGothic-Bold
			(any other cid-keyed non-otf file would do)
test004.pe
  mingliu.ttc		(any other ttc file would do)

test005.pe
  VKern.sfd

================================================================================

This directory also includes the file randomtest.c . This program takes a
directory of good fonts, makes copies of them, introduces random errors into
those copies, and runs fontanvil on the result. If ff crashes it saves the
test, otherwise it deletes it. Then it tries another test.
