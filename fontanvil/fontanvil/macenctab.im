/* Comment from George Williams in the part of the FontForge macenc.c
 * source file which these auto-generated tables replace:

     The original data for these mappings may be found at
       http://www.unicode.org/Public/MAPPINGS/VENDORS/APPLE/
     unfortunately this site does not contain all the macintosh encodings
     so we leave some blank

     Response (indirectly) from charsets@apple.com when asked about the
     missing encodings:

        > I don't believe any of those additional scripts are actually
        > defined as character encodings. He can safely ignore anything
        > that's not in the Apple folder on the Unicode site.
        >
        > I monitor charsets@apple.com and don't recall seeing any e-mail
        > on this subject. It's possible it got lost in the voluminous

        >

     I find this perplexing (unless the script is defined but unused, how can
     it fail to have a defined encoding), but will accept it.

 * George wrote that at some unspecified distant point in the past.  As of
 * the current writing (Matthew Skala, June 2015), there are other tables
 * available at the Unicode Consortium URL mentioned above, that were not
 * included in the FontForge source file.  Notes below decribe what I think
 * is going on with those files.
 *
 * For the moment these lookups cover only Mac 8-bit encodings.  I may add
 * 16-bit encodings if I can figure out how the FontForge code handles them.
