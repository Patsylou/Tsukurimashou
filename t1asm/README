This directory contains a copy of the t1asm utility, originally by
I. Lee Hetherington, with further development by Eddie Kohler.  This is
part of version 1.37 the t1utils package, which is available from:
   http://www.lcdf.org/~eddietwo/type/#t1utils

For general use, I recommend getting and installing that package.  This
bundled copy of t1asm is intended just for building Tsukurimashou, so that
there'll be one less dependency for Tsukurimashou builders to worry about.
Accordingly, it's integrated into the Tsukurimashou build system, and the
Tsukurimashou build will not install it when Tsukurimashou is installed.

Files in this directory have their own copyrights separate from
Tsukurimashou's; see the individual files for more information on
licensing, and contact information for the authors.
